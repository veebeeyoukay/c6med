The company coordinates conference strategies, plans thought leader engagements, and manages workload for internal marketing and medical teams of pharmaceutical clients. C6 Med is undergoing growth, converting 1099 contractors to W-2 employees, and requires a streamlined cybersecurity solution to meet compliance standards set forth in pharmaceutical Master Service Agreements (MSAs) and to secure a cybersecurity insurance policy.Assessment MethodologyThis assessment follows the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, which includes six core functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The evaluation was conducted through stakeholder interviews with key personnel at C6 Med.Interview Participants:? Barbara Wynne - Team Member (Medical Communications)? Jen Kulpa - Content Developer? Jennifer Mellace - Team Member? Julie Krauss - Medical Expert Engagement Planner? Marcy Duval - Owner/LeaderNIST CSF Assessment Results1. GovernCurrent StatusC6 Med is transitioning from an informal organizational structure to a more formalized business with defined security requirements. The company operates with minimal formal governance in place. Roles and responsibilities are understood but not formally documented from a security perspective. The team works primarily with pharmaceutical clients and handles sensitive data including medical expert lists. The company is in the process of converting 1099 contractors to W-2 employees, with 8 core team members identified. There is a recognized need to meet MSA requirements, with a particular focus on a recent Novartis agreement that includes specific information security requirements.Risks? Lack of formal security policies and procedures could lead to non-compliance with client MSA requirements? Absence of documented roles and responsibilities for security could result in gaps and inconsistencies? Limited oversight of third-party risk management increases potential exposure? No formal process for data classification and handling increases risk of data leakage? Ad-hoc approach to security decision-making without clear governance structureOpportunities? Development of a Written Information Security Program aligned with NIST CSF? Implementation of governance structure appropriate for a small business? Creation of formal security roles and responsibilities as part of W-2 employee transition? Development of clear data classification guidelines for handling client information? Establishment of consistent security review process for client MSAs2. IdentifyCurrent StatusC6 Med team members use various technologies and platforms to handle client data, including Microsoft Office 365, Dropbox, SharePoint, and Teams. The company currently has a website hosted on Amazon but requires updates to reflect their business more accurately. Team members use personal devices for work purposes (BYOD approach) and have different levels of technical proficiency. Some team members have company email addresses while others use personal accounts. The team is uncertain about the exact technical specifications of their devices, particularly regarding encryption status. Staff members have varying levels of awareness about information security risks, with some relying on family members for technical support.Risks? Incomplete asset inventory of hardware, software, and data? Uncertain encryption status of employee devices handling sensitive client data? Use of personal email accounts for business communications with pharmaceutical clients? Limited understanding of the technical environment and security configurations? Varying levels of cybersecurity awareness among team members? No formal risk assessment process in place to identify and prioritize risksOpportunities? Create a comprehensive asset inventory including all devices, software, and data repositories? Implement a formal risk assessment methodology aligned with NIST CSF? Conduct a data flow mapping exercise to understand how sensitive information moves through the organization? Develop a technical baseline configuration for all devices accessing company data? Establish a vulnerability management process appropriate for a small business? Evaluate the business website security and establish proper access controls3. ProtectCurrent StatusThe team works with sensitive information, particularly lists of medical experts provided by pharmaceutical clients. Staff members generally have good password hygiene but inconsistent practices, with some using the same password across multiple accounts. There is minimal use of two-factor authentication (2FA), but some team members have implemented it for personal accounts. Team members use a mix of personal devices and have varying approaches to system updates, with some relying on family members for technical support. Data is stored across multiple platforms including Dropbox, SharePoint, and client-specific environments such as Novartis Teams. Staff members often work from different locations, including while traveling, and use public Wi-Fi and hotspots.Risks? Inconsistent password management practices increase vulnerability to credential-based attacks? Limited implementation of 2FA across business applications? Irregular system updates and patching create security vulnerabilities? Use of multiple data storage platforms increases attack surface and complicates access management? No formal data backup procedures established for work on personal devices? Use of public Wi-Fi for accessing sensitive client information? Lack of formal security awareness training program? No standardized approach to access management as team transitions to employeesOpportunities? Implement enterprise password management solution (LastPass Enterprise suggested)? Establish mandatory 2FA for all business applications? Create formal BYOD policy with minimum security requirements? Consolidate data storage platforms to reduce complexity and improve security? Develop formal data backup procedures? Implement VPN solution for secure remote access? Create security awareness training program? Establish access management procedures aligned with principle of least privilege4. DetectCurrent StatusC6 Med has minimal detection capabilities in place. Some team members have antivirus software (McAfee mentioned), but there is no standardized approach to endpoint protection. Team members have varying abilities to identify suspicious emails and potential phishing attempts, with some relying on visual cues or consultation with family members. No formal logging or monitoring systems are in place beyond what may be provided by the platforms they use (Office 365, Dropbox). There is no systematic approach to vulnerability scanning or penetration testing. Staff may not know how to report security incidents if they occur.Risks? Limited ability to detect security incidents in a timely manner? Inconsistent endpoint protection across personal devices? Varying levels of ability to identify phishing attempts among staff? No centralized logging or monitoring capability? Lack of visibility into potential security vulnerabilities? No formal security incident reporting processOpportunities? Establish minimum standards for endpoint protection on all devices? Implement email security filtering for phishing protection? Create security awareness training focused on threat detection? Develop formal incident reporting procedures? Implement basic logging and monitoring appropriate for small business? Consider vulnerability scanning service for critical assets5. RespondCurrent StatusC6 Med does not have formal incident response capabilities or documented procedures. Team members would likely rely on individual judgment and personal contacts for addressing security issues. There is no established chain of communication for security incidents, and team members may handle potential security events differently. Some staff members rely on family members for technical support when issues arise. There is no defined process for communicating with clients about potential security incidents. Some team members delete suspicious emails rather than marking them as spam or reporting them through formal channels.Risks? Lack of formal incident response plan could lead to ineffective or inconsistent responses? No defined roles and responsibilities during a security incident? Limited technical capability to investigate and contain security incidents? No established communication protocols for security events? Potential compliance issues with client notification requirements in MSAs? Reliance on informal support networks rather than professional security resourcesOpportunities? Develop a simple incident response plan appropriate for a small business? Establish clear roles and responsibilities for incident response? Create communication templates for potential security incidents? Implement basic containment and recovery procedures? Establish relationship with external security expertise for incident support? Align incident response approach with client MSA requirements6. RecoverCurrent StatusC6 Med has minimal formal recovery capabilities in place. Team members have inconsistent backup practices, with some uncertain about what backup mechanisms are in place for their devices. There is no formal business continuity or disaster recovery planning documented. Critical business data is spread across multiple platforms (Dropbox, SharePoint, client platforms) which complicates recovery planning. The team has demonstrated adaptability and flexibility in responding to challenges, suggesting good informal resilience. There appears to be no testing of recovery capabilities.Risks? Inconsistent data backup approaches could lead to data loss? Lack of formal business continuity planning? Distributed data across multiple platforms complicates recovery efforts? No testing of recovery capabilities? Potential extended downtime during recovery efforts? Possible compliance issues with client recovery time requirementsOpportunities? Implement consistent backup solution for all business data? Develop simple business continuity plan focused on critical operations? Consolidate data storage to streamline recovery processes? Create recovery procedures for different scenarios? Establish recovery time objectives aligned with business needs? Integrate recovery planning with employee onboarding processRisk Assessment SummaryRisk IDRisk DescriptionNIST CSF CategoryLikelihoodImpactRisk RatingRecommended MitigationR1Lack of formal security policies and proceduresGovernHighHighCriticalDevelop Written Information Security Program (WISP) aligned with NIST CSFR2Inconsistent password management and limited 2FAProtectHighHighCriticalImplement enterprise password manager and mandate 2FA for business applicationsR3Use of personal devices without encryption verificationIdentify, ProtectHighHighCriticalEstablish BYOD policy with minimum security requirements including encryptionR4Multiple data storage platforms increasing complexityProtectMediumHighHighConsolidate data storage to SharePoint/O365 with appropriate access controlsR5Limited security awareness among team membersProtectMediumMediumMediumImplement security awareness training programR6No formal incident response or recovery capabilitiesRespond, RecoverMediumHighHighDevelop basic incident response and business continuity plansR7Use of public Wi-Fi for accessing sensitive dataProtectHighMediumHighImplement VPN solution for remote workR8Irregular system updates and patchingProtectMediumMediumMediumEstablish system update requirements and verification processR9No formal third-party risk managementIdentifyMediumMediumMediumDevelop vendor assessment process aligned with business needsR10Limited detection capabilities for security eventsDetectMediumHighHighImplement standardized endpoint protection and email securityImplementation RoadmapPhase 1: Immediate Actions (0-30 days)?
