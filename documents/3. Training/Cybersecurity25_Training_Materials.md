- Test audio for remote participants
- Have sign-in sheet ready

### Slide 2: Welcome & Objectives (3 minutes)
**Script:** "By the end of today's session, you'll have practical tools and knowledge to be C6Med's first line of defense. Security isn't just an IT responsibility - it's something we all own together."

**Discussion Prompt:** "Quick show of hands - who's had a suspicious email this week?"

**Timing Note:** Keep introductions brief to maintain energy

### Slide 3: Why This Matters (5 minutes)
**Script:** "Let me share why this is critical for us. We handle sensitive data for Novartis, Novo Nordisk, and Regeneron. One breach could cost millions and destroy client trust. But this isn't just about work - these practices protect your personal life too."

**Real Example Discussion:** "In 2023, a pharmaceutical vendor was breached through a phishing email. The employee thought it was from the FDA about a clinical trial update. It exposed data for 500,000 patients and cost the company $15 million in fines and remediation."

**Activity:** Ask participants to share (voluntarily) if they know anyone affected by identity theft or fraud

## Section 1: Password & Authentication Security (15 minutes)

### Slides 4-7: Password Management & MFA (15 minutes total)

#### Slide 4: Our Security Journey (1 minute)
**Script:** "We've organized our 25 topics into three main sections. We'll start with foundations, move to work practices, and finish with advanced protection strategies."

#### Slide 5: Password Fundamentals (4 minutes)
**Script:** "Let's start with passwords. I know everyone groans when we talk about passwords, but they're still our first line of defense. The problem is we're human - we can't remember hundreds of unique, complex passwords."

**Interactive Element:** "Without saying it out loud, think about your most-used password. How many accounts use that same password? Be honest with yourself."

**Key Points:**
- Emphasize passphrases over complex passwords
- Show examples on screen
- Address the "but it's too hard" objection

#### Slide 6: Password Managers (4 minutes)
**Script:** "This is where password managers save the day. Think of it as a secure vault that remembers everything so you don't have to. You just need one strong master password."

**Demo Preparation:** Have screenshot or quick demo ready
**Address Concerns:** "I know some of you might think 'what if the password manager gets hacked?' - We'll discuss why that's still safer than reusing passwords."

#### Slide 7: Multi-Factor Authentication (6 minutes)
**Script:** "MFA is like having a deadbolt in addition to your regular lock. Even if someone steals your password, they can't get in without the second factor."

**Hands-On Activity:** "Everyone take out your phone. Let's look at your email app. Who already has MFA enabled? Great! For those who don't, I'll show you how right after this session."

**Client Requirement Emphasis:** "This is mandatory for accessing any client systems. Novartis specifically requires app-based MFA, not SMS."

**Pharma Context:** "Attackers know we work in pharma. They'll use FDA warnings, clinical trial deadlines, or regulatory compliance to create urgency."

#### Slide 9: Phishing Response (4 minutes)
**Script:** "When you spot a phish, your response matters. Speed is more important than perfection. If you clicked on something suspicious, tell us immediately. We won't be angry - we'll be grateful."

**Scenario Discussion:** "What if you receive a suspicious email that appears to be from our Novartis contact about an urgent project?"

#### Slide 10: Email Security (4 minutes)
**Script:** "Beyond phishing, we need to think about email security broadly. Every email is a potential risk or opportunity to protect our data."

**Client-Specific Training:** Review each client's specific requirements
- Show screenshots of client portals
- Demonstrate encryption tools

#### Slide 11: Safe Browsing (3 minutes)
**Script:** "The web is essential for research, but it's also full of dangers. That padlock icon is your friend - always look for it when entering any information."

**Pharma Research Context:** "When researching drug information or clinical trials, stick to verified sources. Fake pharma sites are common and often contain malware."

#### Slide 12: Social Engineering (4 minutes)
**Script:** "Social engineering is psychological manipulation. Attackers use our helpful nature against us. In pharma, they often pose as doctors needing urgent access to data or FDA officials requiring immediate compliance information."
