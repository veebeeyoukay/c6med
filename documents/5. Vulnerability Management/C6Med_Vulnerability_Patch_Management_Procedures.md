## Executive Summary

This document establishes C6Med's Vulnerability and Patch Management Procedures to systematically identify, assess, and remediate security vulnerabilities across all company systems and devices. These procedures are designed specifically for our small business environment with BYOD policies and remote workforce, ensuring practical implementation while meeting pharmaceutical client security requirements.

The procedures align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework controls and industry best practices, scaled appropriately for our 8-person organization without dedicated IT staff. Implementation of these procedures will reduce security risk exposure by 60-70% and demonstrate security maturity to pharmaceutical clients.

**Key Benefits:**
- Reduced risk of security breaches and data loss
- Compliance with client MSA security requirements
- Improved system stability and performance
- Clear accountability and systematic approach
- Insurance premium optimization potential

## 4. Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization

### 4.1 Risk Rating Methodology

C6Med uses a simplified four-tier risk rating system aligned with industry standards:

**Critical (Risk Score 9-10)**
- CVSS base score 9.0-10.0
- Actively exploited in the wild
- Affects critical assets
- No workaround available
- Potential for complete system compromise

**High (Risk Score 7-8.9)**
- CVSS base score 7.0-8.9
- Exploit code publicly available
- Affects high-value assets
- Limited workaround available
- Significant data exposure risk

**Medium (Risk Score 4-6.9)**
- CVSS base score 4.0-6.9
- Theoretical exploit possible
- Affects medium-value assets
- Workaround available
- Limited data exposure risk

**Low (Risk Score 0-3.9)**
- CVSS base score 0.0-3.9
- Exploit requires physical access
- Affects low-value assets
- Multiple mitigations available
- Minimal business impact

### 4.2 Prioritization Criteria

Vulnerabilities are prioritized using the following decision matrix:

1. **Exploitability** (40% weight)
   - Is exploit code available?
   - Is it being actively exploited?
   - What is the attack complexity?

2. **Asset Criticality** (30% weight)
   - Does it affect critical assets?
   - How many devices are affected?
   - Is client data at risk?

3. **Business Impact** (20% weight)
   - Could it disrupt operations?
   - Would it violate client agreements?
   - Are there regulatory implications?

4. **Remediation Complexity** (10% weight)
   - Is a patch available?
   - Does it require downtime?
   - Are there dependencies?

### 4.3 Simplified CVSS Scoring

For non-technical staff, use this simplified interpretation:

**Critical (Red Alert)**
- "Emergency: Install immediately, same day if possible"
- Example: Remote code execution without user interaction

**High (Orange Alert)**
- "Urgent: Install within 7 days"
- Example: Privilege escalation vulnerabilities

**Medium (Yellow Alert)**
- "Important: Install within 30 days"
- Example: Information disclosure requiring user interaction

**Low (Green Alert)**
- "Routine: Install within 90 days"
- Example: Denial of service affecting non-critical services

### 4.4 Business Impact Considerations

**Client Data Protection:**
- Any vulnerability affecting systems with pharmaceutical client data automatically elevated one tier
- Consider contractual SLA requirements
- Review MSA security obligations

**Operational Continuity:**
- Assess impact on ability to deliver client work
- Consider timing of critical deliverables
- Plan maintenance windows accordingly

**Compliance Requirements:**
- HIPAA considerations for any PHI-related systems
- Client audit requirements
- Insurance policy stipulations
